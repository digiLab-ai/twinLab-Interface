    """Parameter configuration for the emulator.

    Attributes:
        detrend (bool, optional): Should the linear trend in the data be removed (detrended) before training the emulator?
            The defaults is ``False``.
        kernel (Union[str, None], optional): Specifies the functions that build up the kernel (covariance matrix) of the Gaussian Process.
            Previously this argument was called ``covar_module``, but this has been deprecated.
            The default is ``None``, which means the library will use a default kernel, which is a scaled Matern 5/2.
            This can be chosen from a list of possible kernels:

            - ``"LIN"``: Linear.
            - ``"M12"``: Matern 1/2. A standard kernel for capturing data with a smooth trend
            - ``"M32"``: Matern 3/2. A standard kernel for capturing data with a smooth trend.
            - ``"M52"``: Matern 5/2. A standard kernel for capturing data with a smooth trend.
            - ``"PER"``: Periodic. Good for capturing data that has a periodic structure.
            - ``"RBF"``: Radial Basis Function. A standard kernel for capturing data with a smooth trend.
              A good default choice that can model smooth functions.
            - ``"RQF"``: Rational Quadratic Function.

            Kernels can also be composed by using combinations of the ``"+"`` (addative) and ``"*"`` (multiplicative) operators.
            For example, ``kernel = "(M52*PER)+RQF"`` is valid.

            Kernel Composition:
                The kernel parameter allows for the composition of different kernels to better capture complex systems where you have prior knowledge of trends in your data.
                Composition is achieved through the use of ``"+"`` and ``"*"`` operators, which represent additive and multiplicative compositions, respectively.
                Additive Composition (``"+"``): Combining kernels using the ``"+"`` operator allows the emulator to capture patterns that are present in the sum of the features represented by the individual kernels.
                For instance, if one kernel captures a linear trend and another captures periodicity, using ``"+"`` would enable the emulator to capture both linear and periodic trends in the data.
                Multiplicative Composition (``"*"``): The ``"*"`` operator combines kernels in a way that the resulting kernel captures interactions between the features represented by the individual kernels.
                This is useful for capturing complex patterns that arise from the interaction of simpler ones. For example, the kernel expression ``LIN*LIN`` would capture a quadratic trend in the data.

                Parentheses can be used to control the order of operations in kernel composition, similar to arithmetic expressions.
                It's important to carefully consider the choice of kernels as improperly chosen kernels or compositions may lead to poor emulator performance.

        estimator_type (str, optional): Specifies the type of Gaussian process to use for the emulator.
            The default is ``"single_task_gp"``, but the value can be chosen from the following list:

            - ``"single_task_gp"``: The standard Gaussian Process, which learns a mean, covariance, and noise level.
            - ``"fixed_noise_gp"``: A Gaussian Process with fixed noise, which is specified by the user.
              Particularly useful for capturing noise-free simulated data where the noise can be set to zero manually.
            - ``"heteroskedastic_gp"``: A Gaussian Process with fixed noise that is allowed to vary with the input.
              The noise is specified by the user, and is also learned by the Process.
            - ``"variational_gp"``: An approximate Gaussian Process that is more efficient to train with large datasets.
            - ``"mixed_single_task_gp"``: A Gaussian Process that works with a mix of continuous and categorical or discrete input data.
            - ``"multi_fidelity_gp"``:  A Gaussian Process that works with input data that has multiple levels of fidelity.
              For example, combined data from both a high- and low-resolution simulation.
              Use of this model requires setting the ``fidelity`` parameter in the ``TrainParams`` class.
            - ``"fixed_noise_multi_fidelity_gp"``: A Gaussian Process that works with input data that has multiple levels of fidelity and fixed noise.
            - ``"mixture_of_experts_gp"``: A Gaussian Process that trains multiple experts for different regions of the input space.
              This can improve the flexibility and adaptation of the overall function to the patterns of data in specific areas.
              Use of this requires setting the ``class_column`` parameter in the ``TrainParams`` class.
            - ``"classification_gp"``: A Gaussian Process model that is trained to classify data into two classes.
              Predictions from this model are binary, and the returned error is the class probability.
            - ``"zero_noise_gp"``: A Gaussian Process model that is trained with zero noise.

    Attributes:
        estimator (str, optional): The type of estimator (emulator) to be trained.
            Currently only "gaussian_process_regression" is supported, which is the default value.
        estimator_params (EstimatorParams, optional): The set of parameters for the emulator.

        fidelity (Union[str, None], optional): Name of the column in the dataset corresponding to the fidelity parameter if a multi-fidelity model (``estimator_type="multi_fidelity_gp"`` in ``EstimatorParams``) is being trained.
            Fidelity is used to differentiate the quality of individual data samples on which the emulator is being trained.
            The default value is ``None``, because this argument is not required unless a multi-fidelity model is being trained.
        class_column (Union[str, None], optional): The name of the column that contains the classification labels if training a mixture-of-experts model (``estimator_type="mixture_of_experts_gp"`` in EstimatorParams).
            The classification labels distinguish different groups of data, which the emulator uses to train a set of expert models tailored to each group.

            This must be a number beteen 0 and 1.
            The default value is 1, which means that all of the provided data is used for training.
            This is good to make the most out of a dataset, but means that it will not be possible to score or benchmark the performance of an emulator.
        dataset_std (Union[Dataset, None], optional): A twinLab dataset object that contains the standard deviation of the training data.
            This is necessary when training a heteroskedastic or fixed noise emulator.
        model_selection (bool, optional): Whether to run Bayesian model selection, a form of automatic machine learning.
            The default value is ``False``, which simply trains the specified emulator, rather than iterating over them.
        model_selection_params (ModelSelectionParams, optional): The parameters for model selection, if it is being used.
        shuffle (bool, optional): Whether to randomly shuffle the training data before splitting it into training and testing sets.

        seed (Union[int, None], optional): The seed used to initialise the random number generators for reproducibility.
            Setting to an integer is necessary for reproducible results.
            The default value is ``42``, which is useful for reproducibility, but it can be set to ``None`` to randomly generate the seed each time.
            Be aware that the seed is used in the training process, so if the seed is set to ``None`` the trained emulator will not be reproducible.

    Attributes:
        metric (str, optional): Metric used for scoring the performance of an emulator.
            Can be one of:

            - "MSLL": The mean standardised log loss (MSLL), calculated as the mean of the log loss of the emulator minus the mean log loss of a trivial model.
              The log loss is defined as the negative log of the probability of getting the test data value according to a predicted distribution.
              The trivial model is taken to be a Gaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation equal to those of the training data.
              Lower (more negative) scores are better, while positive scores indicate serious problems (a model that is less good than the extremely-trivial naive model).
              The MSLL can be thought of as a measure of how good a model is, as opposed to just taking the average and standard deviation of the training data.
              This is the default metric, and the only metric that accounts for the model uncertainty, which is usually necessary when training a probabilistic model.
            - "MSE": The mean squared error (MSE) is the average of the squared differences between your predicted mean values and those of the test set.
              The MSE quantifies deviations in the model mean predictions only, and is not affected by the model uncertainty estimates.
              A value of zero indicates a model that fits to the data perfectly, but this is not necessarily desirable, as it may indicate overfitting.
            - "RMSE": The root mean squared error (RMSE) is the square root of the MSE and provides a measure of the expected error in the output.
              The RMSE may be considered more interpretable than the MSE, because it shares the same units as the output values.
              However, like the MSE and R2, since model uncertainty is not apart of how this metric is calculated, a desirable RMSE score may belie an underlying poorly-fitting model.
            - "R2": A dimensionless number calculated as one minus the ratio of the MSE to the variance of the test set.
              A value of 1 indicates a perfect model, while a value of 0 indicates a model that is no better than the mean of the test set.
              Negative values are possible but unusual, and indicate a model that is worse than simply taking the mean of the test set.
              As with MSE and RMSE, the model uncertainty is not accounted for in this score; thus, it is possible to have a high R2 score, but a poorly-fitting model.

            The default metric is "MSLL".

        combined_score (bool, optional): Determine whether to combine (average) the emulator score across output dimensions.
            If False, a dataframe of scores will be returned, with the score for each output dimension,
            even if there is only a single emulator output dimension.
            If True, a single number will be returned, which is the average score across all output dimensions.

            - ``"interval"``: The calibration curve is calculated over confidence intervals.

            The default is ``"quantile"``.

            For example, for a well calibrated emulator one would expect to have 10 percent of the unseen datapoints (from the test set) to be outside of the emulator's 90 percent confidence bound.
            If a given confidence interval contains less than expected amount of data the model is underconfident, whereas if it contains more then it is overconfident.
            The calibration curve is necessarily equal to ``0`` and ``1`` at the beginning and end respectively, as the fraction of data within the entire confidence interval must be between 0 and 1.
            Curves are also necessarily monotonically increasing.
            Convex calibration curves (those below the line ``y = x``) indicate that the model is underconfident,
            while concave calibration curves (those above the line ``y = x``) indicate that the model is overconfident.
            It is possible for a curve to be both above and below the line ``y = x``, indicating regions of under- and overconfidence, and possible non-Gaussianity in the data.

            If ``type = "quantile"`` then the calibration curve is calculated over statistical quantiles extending from negative infinity to positive infinity.

            If ``type = "interval"`` then the calibration curve is calculated over confidence intervals,
            starting from the mean of the distribution and extending outwards in both directions simultaneously until the entire confidence interval is covered at negative/positive infinity.

            A list of weighting values that are used to create a scalar objective function in the case of a multi-output model.
            The recommend functionality can only work on a single scalar function, so in the case of a multi-output model, the outputs must be combined into a single scalar value.
            The weights create a linear combinations of the outputs, where the weights are the coefficients of the linear combination.
            In the case of a single-output model, the weights are not used and have no impact.
            If the output dimensions are not equally important, the weights can be used to reflect this.
            If the output values have different units, the weights must be chosen to reflect this.
            For example, if two outputs have units of distance and time the weights implicitly have units such that these can be combined (i.e., per metre and per second).
            A list of values is used here, where the first value corresponds to the first output, the second value to the second output, and so on.
            For example, ``[1, 2, 3]`` would create a linear combination of the outputs where the first output is multiplied by 1, the second output by 2, and the third output by 3.
            In this case, the third output is considered to be three times as important as the first output.
            If the values ``[0, 1]`` are used, the first output is ignored and the second output is used as the scalar objective function.
            If the values ``[-1, 0]`` are used, the first output is used as the scalar objective function, and is minimized.

            For example, ``{"x0": (0, 1), "x1": (0, 2)}`` to set boundaries on two input variables ``x0`` and ``x1``.
